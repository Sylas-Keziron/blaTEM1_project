# blaTEM-1 Bioinformatics Analysis Project

This project is a practical application of fundamental bioinformatics techniques, focusing on the analysis of **blaTEM-1 beta-lactamase gene homologs**. It demonstrates how to retrieve sequence data, perform homology searches using NCBI BLAST, analyze nucleotide content, and visualize results using Python and Biopython.

## Objectives

- Retrieve the **blaTEM-1** gene sequence from NCBI
- Perform a **BLASTn** search for homologous sequences
- Parse and analyze selected hits using **Biopython**
- Calculate **GC content**, **sequence lengths**, and **translation**
- Save analysis results to a structured output folder
- Build a portfolio summary for publishing

## How to Run

> This assumes you’ve cloned this repo and have Python set up on your system.

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install biopython

2. Run the analysis script:
   python scripts/analyze_hits.py
   
3. Check the results/ folder for:

-Parsed FASTA files
-GC content and stats
-Translated protein sequences
